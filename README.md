## CodeMon: Gotta Code 'Em All!

**Concept:**

CodeMon blends the classic monster-catching fun of Pokémon with the educational power of learning to code. Players embark on a journey to catch and train CodeMons, but instead of brute force battles, they conquer challenges by writing code!

**Features:**

* **Coding Challenges:** Each CodeMon encounter presents a coding challenge based on the Pokémon's level and type. Solve the challenge to deal damage and capture the CodeMon.
* **Multiple Programming Languages:** Hone your skills in Python (initial implementation). Future updates may include JavaScript and C#.
* **AI Tutor:** Get guidance and feedback on your code from your friendly AI companion.
* **Level Up and Evolve:** As you progress, your CodeMons will level up, unlocking new skills and challenges.
* **Explore the World:** Journey through a vibrant world, encountering diverse CodeMons and facing increasingly complex challenges.

**Technology Stack:**

* Frontend: React, Kaboom.js
* Backend: Django
* AI: TensorFlow.js (potential)
